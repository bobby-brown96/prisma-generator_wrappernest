## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This is a Prisma Generator for creating Nestjs Entities, Dtos, Services, Controllers, and Modules to be used as the basis for a REST API. This was developed for a personal project and is very specific to my use case.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This isn't a starting place to learn prisma. Go to [prisma.io](https://www.prisma.io/) or [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) for more information about the foundation of this project.

Make sure you have installed [@prisma/client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prisma/client) and [Prisma](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma)

```
npm i -D prisma @prisma/client
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
npm i -D prisma-generator_wrappernest
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
